# Focus

_Multiplatform application to help students focus on their studying time._

## Motivation

I had trouble focusing while studying for my college exams. I found and used some apps that helped with my concentration by reproducing ambiental sounds, or 5217 timer [(Learn more about 5217 theory)](https://bulletproofmusician.com/how-to-intensify-your-focus-and-be-more-productive-with-the-5217-split/). Hence, I came up with the idea of developing an app with both functionalities (better idea than actually studying for the tests).

In addition, I had already developed some Java games for mobile. Then, I started to check on other frameworks and libraries that I did not know about. I found some videos about a framework called Flutter, which seemed really fun to code with. However, although it was very stable, Flutter was in beta at that time. I decided to start developing it given that I really like challenges.

## What I learned

As this was the first time I experimented with Flutter, I learned it together with Dart, which is the language Flutter is written with. 

I faced two big problems during the development of this application. To begin with, I didn't know much about software architecture and design patterns (as at that time I was coursing my second year of college), so I had trouble managing the global state of the application. Secondly, I also learned about the importance of stability of a framework or library, as at the time I was developing this application there were no good audio libraries that supported well looped noises. 

Eventually, I had to start studying for my tests so I abandoned the development of this application.
